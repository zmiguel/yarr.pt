## Miscellaneous Info
<h4>Can we remove an info_hash from the tracker?</h4>

<p>No, the technology doesn't include any support for blocking info_hash keys from being registered with the tracker. We only know how many info_hashes there are, not what the information behind the hash is.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear so people sending copyright takedown notices understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not have any content.</li>
<li>We are not a bittorrent site, we are just a tracker, we can not see what content is behind an info_hash.</li>
<li>We don't have any torrent files.</li>
<li>We can't give you any IP addresses in any other way than normal tracker usage.</li>
<li>We can't verify any claims when we have no data other than the info_hash.</li>
<li>We can't block info_hash keys from being registered with the tracker.</li>
<li>We don't have any logs or ways to trace previous connections, It's not technically possible to trace connection history due to the sheer volume of connections. The only information that is possible to keep is the current torrent swarm.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should you as a content owner do? Contact the indexing site where the torrent download originated from and ask them nicely to remove the listing and the .torrent file!</p>

## Terms of Service
<pre><code>Our tracker system (hereby "the tracker") is free of charge for anyone for personal usage. Organizations (for instance, but not limited to, non-profit or companies) may use the system if they clear this with the system operators first. Permission for organizations/companies is not needed for obvious "well meaning" usage, i.e. distributing works of cultural benefit for the end user.

The tracker may not be used by anyone with the intention to track usage, log IP addresses/usage, DoS attack, or anything else that we consider intrusion of privacy or disruption of tracker service. If you are not sure if this would be the case for your usage, please contact us in order to get our permission.

The tracker is run privately. That means that we do not guarantee that the tracker will be available for users at all times, but we try our best to make the tracker run stable. We take no responsibility for loss of income or similar due to tracker downtime/failure.

The responsibility lies upon the user to not spread malicious, false or illegal material using the tracker.
We do not censor, but we may block people that use our service wrongfully (i.e. commercial organizations that have not cleared the usage with us first).

We reserve the rights to charge for usage of the tracker in case this policy is violated. The charge will consist of a basic fee of EUR 5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation.
Personal usage, although violating this policy, will not be charged. We will simply block those users.

We also reserve the rights to publish any information regarding violations. Info hashes, IP addresses and all other information that is supplied to the tracker will be considered our right to publish, though minimal data is kept due to the system requirements. We do respect your privacy, and hence will never disclose any information about you without it being a well-needing reason.

This policy may change at any time, please check in before using the tracker.

Connecting to any of our trackers, DNS servers, and any other method of connecting means that you accept this policy agreement.</code></pre>
