<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
<pre><code>Our tracker system (hereby "the tracker") is free of charge for anyone for personal usage. Organizations (for instance, but not limited to, non-profit or companies) may use the system if they clear this with the system operators first. Permission for organizations/companies is not needed for obvious "well meaning" usage, i.e. distributing works of cultural benefit for the end user.

The tracker may not be used by anyone with the intention to track usage, log IP addresses/usage, DoS attack, or anything else that we consider intrusion of privacy or disruption of tracker service. If you are not sure if this would be the case for your usage, please contact us in order to get our permission.

The tracker is run privately. That means that we do not guarantee that the tracker will be available for users at all times, but we try our best to make the tracker run stable. We take no responsibility for loss of income or similar due to tracker downtime/failure.

The responsibility lies upon the user to not spread malicious, false or illegal material using the tracker.
We do not censor, but we may block people that use our service wrongfully (i.e. commercial organizations that have not cleared the usage with us first).

We reserve the rights to charge for usage of the tracker in case this policy is violated. The charge will consist of a basic fee of EUR 5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation.
Personal usage, although violating this policy, will not be charged. We will simply block those users.

We also reserve the rights to publish any information regarding violations. Info hashes, IP addresses and all other information that is supplied to the tracker will be considered our right to publish, though minimal data is kept due to the system requirements. We do respect your privacy, and hence will never disclose any information about you without it being a well-needing reason.

This policy may change at any time, please check in before using the tracker.

Connecting to any of our trackers, DNS servers, and any other method of connecting means that you accept this policy agreement.</code></pre>
